# EllipseAI_PredictDroplets
Neural network-based model for predicting the semi-axis features of ellipses that encapsulate primary droplet heads.
# Overview
Within **EllipseAI_PredictDroplets**, you will find a **neural network-based model** designed to predict the **semi-axis values of ellipses** fitted to the heads of droplets identified in images. These images can be downloaded from the following repository: [Zenodo Repository](https://zenodo.org/records/13862494)
