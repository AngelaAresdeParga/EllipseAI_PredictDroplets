# EllipseAI_PredictDroplets
Neural network-based model for predicting the semi-axis features of ellipses that encapsulate primary droplet heads.
# Overview
Within **EllipseAI_PredictDroplets**, you will find a **neural network-based model** designed to predict the **semi-axis values of ellipses** fitted to the heads of droplets identified in images. These images can be downloaded from the following repository: [Zenodo Repository](https://zenodo.org/records/13862494)

The same repository also contains a **database** with the **semi-axis values** and the **operational parameters** that define the voltage signal used by the **[MicroDrop inkjet dispenser device](https://www.microdrop.de/)**, which was used to generate the predicted droplets.  

For more details, you can refer to the following research paper: [_Data-Driven Analysis of Droplet Morphology in Inkjet Systems: Toward Generating Stable Single-Drop Regimes_](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13801) .
