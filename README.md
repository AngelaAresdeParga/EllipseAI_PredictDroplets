# EllipseAI_PredictDroplets
Neural network-based model for predicting the semi-axis features of ellipses that encapsulate primary droplet heads.
# Overview  
Within **EllipseAI_PredictDroplets**, you will find a **pretrained neural network-based model** used to predict the **semi-axis values of ellipses** fitted to the heads of droplets identified in images. 

The images can be downloaded from the following repository: [Zenodo Repository](https://zenodo.org/records/13862494).

Additionally, related Python codes for **controlling, capturing, and processing droplet images** can be found in the following repository: [**InkJetDroplet**](https://github.com/DropletDynamics/InkJetDroplet).  

The semi-axis values are predicted based on the **operational parameters** that define the voltage signal used by the **[MicroDrop inkjet dispenser device](https://www.microdrop.de/)**, which was used to generate the predicted droplets.

The same repository also contains a **database** with the **semi-axis values** and the **operational parameters**.

For more details, you can refer to the following research paper: [_Data-Driven Analysis of Droplet Morphology in Inkjet Systems: Toward Generating Stable Single-Drop Regimes_](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13801).
